This means the development of the front-end (Client-side) and the back-end (Server-side). In the application, the user is presented with a book search, a saved books, and login/sign-up pages. Developing this project demonstrates our full-stack development skills using MERN.

This project was developed with MongoDB. Using MongoDB assisted in forming and structuring of the database models. Along with forming the models. Graphql was used to assist in implementing the methods for the back-end.
